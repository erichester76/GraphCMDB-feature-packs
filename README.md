# Feature Packs Store

This repository is a "store" for feature packs used to expand GraphCMDB.

## Usage
- GraphCMDB will pull the repo on each Feature Packs page load.
- Add a pack to the app via the Feature Packs UI (installs from the store).
- Delete a pack from the app via the Feature Packs UI (removes it from the app, not from the store).
